✅ 1. What is a VPC?
A Virtual Private Cloud is a logically isolated section of AWS where you define your own networking environment (IP range, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.).

✅ 2. What is the CIDR block in VPC?
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) defines the IP address range of the VPC.

✅ 3. What is the default VPC?
AWS provides a default VPC per region with a /16 CIDR block, one public subnet in each AZ, and internet access enabled.

✅ 4. What is the difference between a public and private subnet?
Public subnet: Has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).

Private subnet: No route to IGW.

✅ 5. How does an EC2 in a private subnet access the internet?
Using a NAT Gateway in a public subnet which routes traffic to the Internet Gateway.

✅ 6. What is an Internet Gateway (IGW)?
A horizontally scaled AWS component that allows internet access for public subnets.

✅ 7. What is a NAT Gateway?
A service that allows instances in private subnets to access the internet, but prevents inbound access from the internet.

✅ 8. Difference between NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway?
Feature	NAT Gateway	Internet Gateway
Direction	Outbound only	Inbound & Outbound
Used for	Private subnet	Public subnet

✅ 9. What is a route table in VPC?
Defines how traffic is routed from subnets to other networks (IGW, NAT, VPN, etc.).

✅ 10. What are Network ACLs (NACL)?
Stateless firewall rules applied at the subnet level for inbound/outbound traffic. You must define both.

✅ 11. What is the difference between Security Groups and NACLs?
Security Groups: Stateful, at instance level.

NACLs: Stateless, at subnet level.

✅ 12. Can a subnet span multiple Availability Zones?
❌ No. A subnet is bound to only one AZ.

✅ 13. What is a peering connection in VPC?
Enables traffic routing between two VPCs using private IPs. They must not have overlapping CIDRs.

✅ 14. Can VPC peering be established between different regions?
✅ Yes, called inter-region VPC peering.

✅ 15. What is VPC Flow Logs?
Logs all IP traffic in/out of VPC interfaces. Useful for security auditing and debugging.

✅ 16. What is a VPC endpoint?
Allows private connection between your VPC and AWS services without using internet or NAT.

Gateway endpoint: S3, DynamoDB

Interface endpoint: Other services (uses ENI)

✅ 17. How many IP addresses are reserved in a subnet?
5 IPs are reserved in each subnet:

Network address

Broadcast address

AWS Reserved (.1, .2, .3)

✅ 18. What is the max number of subnets in a VPC?
You can create up to 200 subnets per VPC (default soft limit, can be increased).

✅ 19. What is the maximum VPC size?
Maximum CIDR size is /16 (65,536 IPs), minimum is /28 (16 IPs).

✅ 20. Can two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks?
✅ Yes, but ❌ peering or transit routing will not work unless you use NAT or private link-style workarounds.
