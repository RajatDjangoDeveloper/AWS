🔐 Top 20 IAM Interview Questions with Answers
✅ 1. What is IAM?
AWS service to manage users, groups, roles, and permissions securely.

✅ 2. What is the difference between IAM user and IAM role?
User: Permanent identity with credentials (username/password or access keys).

Role: Temporary identity assumed by users, services, or other AWS accounts.

✅ 3. What are IAM groups?
A collection of IAM users with shared policies attached for easier permission management.

✅ 4. What are IAM policies?
JSON documents that define permissions (Allow/Deny) for users, groups, or roles.

✅ 5. Types of IAM policies?
Managed Policies (AWS or custom)

Inline Policies (attached directly to 1 identity only)

✅ 6. What is a trust policy?
A policy that defines who can assume a role, commonly used with roles (e.g., EC2 assumes a role).

✅ 7. What is AssumeRole?
An AWS STS API that lets you temporarily switch to another role, often cross-account.

✅ 8. How do IAM roles work with EC2?
Assign an IAM role to an EC2 instance to grant it permissions without storing access keys.

✅ 9. What is the IAM policy evaluation logic?
By default: Deny everything

If Allow is found: Allow

If Deny is found: Deny (overrides Allow)

✅ 10. What are permissions boundaries?
Advanced IAM feature that defines the maximum permissions an identity (user/role) can get, even if more are attached.

✅ 11. How do you secure IAM credentials?
Use roles instead of access keys

Rotate credentials regularly

Use MFA

Avoid inline policies

✅ 12. What is MFA in IAM?
Multi-Factor Authentication adds extra verification (like OTP) for secure login and sensitive actions.

✅ 13. What is IAM Access Analyzer?
Tool to find public/shared resources by analyzing policies — helps you reduce unintended access.

✅ 14. How do you debug IAM policy issues?
Use IAM Policy Simulator

Check CloudTrail logs

Verify resource-level permissions

✅ 15. What is the difference between Identity-based and Resource-based policies?
Identity-based: Attached to user/role

Resource-based: Attached to resources (e.g., S3 bucket policy)

✅ 16. Can a single IAM user belong to multiple groups?
✅ Yes. IAM users can be part of multiple groups.

✅ 17. What’s the difference between IAM and Resource Access Manager (RAM)?
IAM: For identity and permission control

RAM: Share resources across accounts/VPCs

✅ 18. How do you enforce least privilege?
Use minimal permissions needed

Enable permission boundaries

Review access with IAM Access Analyzer

✅ 19. What is AWS Organizations in relation to IAM?
Helps centrally manage multiple AWS accounts with consolidated billing and Service Control Policies (SCPs).

✅ 20. How do you give cross-account access using IAM?
Create a role in Account A with trust policy allowing Account B

User in Account B assumes the role via sts:AssumeRole
