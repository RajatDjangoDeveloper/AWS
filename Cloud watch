1. What is CloudWatch?

CloudWatch is Amazon's native monitoring and observability service.
It helps you:
	• Monitor metrics (e.g. CPU, memory, disk)
	• Collect and analyze logs
	• Set alarms to get notified or trigger actions
	• Create dashboards to visualize metrics
	• Trigger automated responses to system events (like EC2 stop/start)

2. CloudWatch Core Components
Component	Purpose
Metrics	Numeric data points (e.g., CPUUtilization)
Logs	Logs from services (Lambda, EC2, ECS, etc.)
Alarms	Watch a metric and trigger actions
Dashboards	Visualize your data
Events / EventBridge	Automation based on rules and schedules


3. CloudWatch Metrics
	• Where they come from: Automatically from AWS services like EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.
	• Granularity: Default is 5 mins. Use “detailed monitoring” for 1-min data.
	• Structure:
		○ Namespace: AWS/EC2, AWS/RDS, etc.
		○ Metric name: CPUUtilization, NetworkIn, etc.
		○ Dimensions: e.g. InstanceId=i-12345678

Hands-On:
	1. Launch EC2 instance
	2. Go to CloudWatch → Metrics → EC2 → Select CPUUtilization
You’ll see a time-series graph

4. CloudWatch Logs
	• Log Groups: Container for logs (e.g., /aws/ec2/mylogs)
	• Log Streams: Sequence of log events from a source
You can:
	• View logs from EC2 (with Agent), Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, etc.
	• Search logs
	• Set retention policies (to avoid storage costs)
🔧 Hands-On:
	• Go to Lambda → View logs in CloudWatch
	• OR install CloudWatch Agent on EC2 to send logs from /var/log

5. CloudWatch Alarms
Let you set thresholds on metrics and take action.
Example: Alert if EC2 CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
🔧 Hands-On:
	1. CloudWatch → Alarms → Create Alarm
	2. Select EC2 CPUUtilization
	3. Threshold: Greater than 80
	4. Action: Send notification (create SNS topic)

6. Dashboards
Use dashboards to visually monitor:
	• EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS metrics
	• Custom metrics
 Hands-On:
	1. Go to CloudWatch → Dashboards → Create Dashboard
	2. Add widgets like graphs, number, text
	3. Select metrics → Add to widget



Steps to Simulate High CPU Usage and Monitor it in AWS CloudWatch
Objective:
To simulate high CPU usage on an EC2 instance and monitor the CPUUtilization metric in real time using AWS CloudWatch.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

Step 2: Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH

Step 3: Create a Python Script to Simulate High CPU Load
	1. Install Python (if not already installed):

sudo yum install python3 -y

	2. Create a new Python file:
	import time
	
	def simulate_cpu_spike(duration=30, cpu_percent=80):
	    print(f"Simulating CPU spike at {cpu_percent}%...")
	    start_time = time.time()
	
	    # Calculate the number of iterations needed to achieve the desired CPU utilization
	    target_percent = cpu_percent / 100
	    total_iterations = int(target_percent * 5_000_000)  # Adjust the number as needed
	
	    # Perform simple arithmetic operations to spike CPU utilization
	    for _ in range(total_iterations):
	        result = 0
	        for i in range(1, 1001):
	            result += i
	
	    # Wait for the rest of the time interval
	    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
	    remaining_time = max(0, duration - elapsed_time)
	    time.sleep(remaining_time)
	
	    print("CPU spike simulation completed.")
	
	if __name__ == '__main__':
	    # Simulate a CPU spike for 30 seconds with 80% CPU utilization
	    simulate_cpu_spike(duration=30, cpu_percent=80)
	
	
Step 4: Enable Detailed Monitoring (Optional for 1-minute resolution)
	1. Go to the EC2 Console and select the instance.
	2. Click on Actions > Manage Detailed Monitoring.
	3. Enable detailed monitoring to get 1-minute metric intervals (this may incur additional cost).

Step 5: Open CloudWatch and Monitor Metrics
	1. In the EC2 Console, navigate to the Monitoring tab.
	2. Click View in CloudWatch to open the CloudWatch metrics view.
	3. Filter the metrics:
		○ Namespace: AWS/EC2
		○ Got to 'Per-Instance Metrics' and apply the filter by running ec2's ID
		○ Select the Metric Name: CPUUtilization
		

Step 6: Adjust the Graph for Real-Time Viewing
	1. Set the time window to the last 5 or 10 minutes.
	2. Change the period to 5 seconds or the lowest allowed based on monitoring granularity.

Step 7: Observe CPU Utilization Increase
	• The CPUUtilization metric will spike toward 80% or higher.
	• CloudWatch will display this change in near real time depending on your selected period and monitoring type.


Steps to Create a CloudWatch Alarm for EC2 CPU ≥ 50% with Email Notification

Objective:
To configure an alarm that triggers when the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance is greater than or equal to 50%, and sends a notification via email.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Open the CloudWatch Console
	1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
	2. Navigate to CloudWatch > Alarms.
	3. Click Create Alarm.

Step 2: Select Metric
	1. Click Select metric.
	2. In the Browse tab, choose:
		○ Browse: EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics
		○ Select the metric: CPUUtilization
		○ Filter by InstanceId to select your target EC2 instance.
	3. Click Select metric.

Step 3: Specify Conditions
	1. Statistic: Choose Average (default).
	2. Period: Select 1 minute or as preferred.
	3. Threshold type: Static.
	4. Condition:
		○ Trigger alarm when CPUUtilization is ≥ 50.

Step 4: Configure Actions
	1. Under Notification, choose In alarm state.
	2. Select Create new topic (or use existing).
	3. Enter a topic name (e.g., HighCPUAlarmTopic).
	4. Enter the recipient email address.
	5. Click Create topic.
Note: A confirmation email will be sent to the provided email. The alarm will not notify until the subscription is confirmed.

Step 5: Add a Name and Review
	1. Enter a name for the alarm, such as EC2-HighCPU-Alarm.
	2. Review the configuration details.
	3. Click Create Alarm.

Step 6: Confirm Email Subscription
	1. Go to your inbox.
	2. Open the email from AWS Notifications.
	3. Click the Confirm subscription link to activate the SNS topic.

Expected Behavior
	• Once the CPU utilization of the EC2 instance reaches or exceeds 50% (based on the specified period), the alarm state will change to ALARM.
	• A notification email will be sent to the subscribed email address.
