EBS
======

**üå©Ô∏è What is AWS EBS?**

**Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a **block-level
storage** service used with **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** instances.

Think
of EBS as a **virtual hard disk** that you attach to your cloud server (EC2). It stores your OS,
apps, and data‚Äîjust like your laptop's C: drive.

**üî∞ For Beginners: Simple Explanation**

**‚úÖ What does "block storage" mean?**

Block
storage stores data in **fixed-sized
blocks**. Each block has a unique address, and the system
can directly read/write from/to any block.

- üñ•Ô∏è It's like the hard disk or SSD in your computer.
- EBS provides **durable, high-performance volumes** that can be **attached to EC2 instances**.

**üß± Types of EBS Volumes**

| **Volume Type** | **Best For** | **Key Feature** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **gp3 (General Purpose SSD)** | Most workloads
  (default) | Balanced
  performance + cost |
| **io2/io2 Block Express** | IOPS-intensive
  apps (DBs) | High durability +
  IOPS |
| **st1 (Throughput HDD)** | Big data, logs,
  streaming data | High throughput |
| **sc1 (Cold HDD)** | Infrequently
  accessed data | Lowest cost,
  archival |

**‚öôÔ∏è How Does EBS Work?**

**Create an EC2 instance.Attach
     an EBS volume (you can think of it like plugging in a hard drive).**

- **Create an EC2 instance.**
- **Attach an EBS volume (you can think of it like plugging in a hard drive).**
1. Inside your EC2 instance:
    - Format it (like using NTFS/ext4).
    - Mount it (assign a folder path).
    - Start storing files on it.

**Data is persisted even if the EC2 instance is stopped
     (unless the volume is deleted).**

- **Data is persisted even if the EC2 instance is stopped (unless the volume is deleted).**

**üîê Key Beginner Concepts**

- **Durable**: Data is stored redundantly in one Availability Zone (AZ).
- **Snapshots**: You can take a backup (snapshot) of a volume and restore it anytime.
- **Detach/Attach**: You can move the volume from one EC2 to another.
- **Encrypted**: EBS supports encryption using AWS KMS for data at rest, in transit, and in snapshots.

**üß† For Professionals: Deep Dive**

**üöÄ Performance Metrics**

| **Metric** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **IOPS** | Input/Output
  operations per second |
| **Throughput** | Total MB/s
  read/write |
| **Latency** | Delay in
  completing an I/O request |
- **gp3** offers **baseline 3,000 IOPS** and **125 MB/s throughput** (can be provisioned up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s).
